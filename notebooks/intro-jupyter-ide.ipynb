When typing  a Python command, you can click `Tab` and JupyterLab will generate a drop-down menu where you can search for commands and methods to complete your code. This is the so-called *Tab completion*. Tab completion is usually very powerful in IDEs like VSCode and Pycharm, but a bit slow and incomplete for JupyterLab.\n",

   "source": [
    "When you write code for an analysis, the code must run in the exact same sequence to yield the same results or to even run at all. Traditional code written in plain text-editors and then run in the terminal, will always do this by definition. Notebooks, on the other hand, make very easy to run cells out of order. It has happened to me dozens of times during the ~3 years I have been using Notebooks, and it is a common complaint on the Internet among data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, out of order execution will not matter that much. You will realize early and fix it. But once in a while, you may introduce a \"bug\" or mistake in your code than can cost you hours of detective work. That is the best case scenario. Worst case scenario, you never realize your mistake and your results will be wrong without you knowing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine you have to run these three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get rid of NA in your data\n",
    "2. Computer the weighted average of two variables\n",
    "3. Create a new variable based on those two variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Several things may go wrong here. First, you may forgot to run the cell cleaning the NA values. Second, you may compute the average first, and run the cell to eliminate the NA values second. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although making such mistakes may sound unlikely, at least in mat experience, is not. Here is a typical scenario: you write the code for cleaning the NA and computing the average on different cells, so everything is nicely organized. Then you go for a coffee and get distracted. Then you come back to your computer, your cursor is on the cell to compute the average, so run that, and keep working. Afterwards, you may spend a good couple of hours writing and running more code, and writing analysis from your results, just to realize several hours later that you forgot to run the cell to clean the NA values. Too bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another one: you suddenly realize you made a mistake in the cell to clean the NA values. You go back, change the cell, and rerun the cell. But ops! you forgot to rerun the previous cell to reload the data into your Notebook, so now your cleaning process is mess up. You go back and rerun that cell. Then you get distracted with your dog barking. Then you go an run the average cell. You get distracted again with an email. Then you go back and remember to run the cell to clean the NA values. There you go: you ran the cells out of order. Again, this simply can't happen with a script, since the script will rerun everything in order from top to bottom each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though you may think that you focus is too good to make such mistakes, it is often the case that people get chronically distracted with working on computers with Internet access. **So, be careful**: if you really need to run long sequences of code, you may consider to switch to a text-file instead of a Notebook."
