    "Popular IDEs for Python are Spyder, PyCharm, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebooks. This are all valid options with advantages and disadvantages. I'll focus in Jupyter Notebooks for a couple of reasons: \n",

    "1. They can be run in cloud-based computing environmnets easily \n",

I will briefly mention such drawbacks later, so you are aware of them. It is also worth notice that VSCode and PyCharm allow for Jupyter-like interfaces, which you can check it our [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) and [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/jupyter-notebook-support.html)."

    "Such characteristics permit to effortlesly reproduce the workflow of most researchers and data scientists: the description of a research problem and methods in prose, plus the code to run the analysis and models to analyze datasets, and the presentation of results in tables and charts. You can even export your computational Notebook into PDF, Markdown, HTML, and others easy to share formats.\n",

    "Jupyter Notebooks evolved from a project called [IPython](https://ipython.org/), which was created by the Colombian Berkeley Professor [Fernando PÃ©rez](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fernando-p%C3%A9rez), who at the time was a graduate student in Physicis at CU Boulder.

    "Although nowadays Jupyter is the most widely used IDE for scientific computing and data science worldwide, the idea of computational notebooks predates Project Jupyter. The first computational notebooks, today named [Wolfram Notebooks](https://www.wolfram.com/notebooks/), were introduced by [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.stephenwolfram.com/) for the [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) programming language. The issue was that Wolfram Mathematica and Wolfram Notebooks are a closed-sources propietary software, i.e., you have to pay for it. \n",
