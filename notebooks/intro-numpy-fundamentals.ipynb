    "Scientific and numerical computing often requires processing massive datasets with complex algorithms. If you are scientists or data professional, you want a programming language than can process data FAST. **The closer a programming language is to machine instructions (binary), the faster it runs**. That's why for decades, programs like C, C++, and Fortran, were the to-go option for data intensive applications in science and technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, writing code in compiled languages like C++ and Fortran can be slow and, frankly, terribly annoying (but that's just me!). Scientist are not coders (although many end up mutating into scientist-coder hybrids over time, but that's a whole other subject). From scientists perspective, **the easier and faster to write code, the better**. High-level programming languages, i.e., languages that are closer to human language rather than to machine language do meet such requirements. The likes of Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, fits the bill: **easy to write, easy to learn, easy to run**. But, instructions written in high-level programming languages are slow to run by computers, for complicated reasons I do not explore here. The fact is that they are slower to run than C++ or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists face a conundrum: they need an **easy to write** AND **fast to run** programming language. They need the best of both worlds. For a long time such language simply did not exist. Then Python came a long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh wait, Python it is, indeed, easy to learn and write, *but slow to run compared to compiled languages*. Like really, really slow. For instance, computing the [spectral-norm of a matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm), which is a common task in data applications, [has been benchmarked](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/performance/spectralnorm.html) at ~1.9 seconds in C, whereas python takes a whopping ~170.1 seconds, meaning that Python is ~90 times *slower*. Considering this, the fact Python became the dominant language in machine learning and data science is a bit of a puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two reasons for this why Python succeed anyways. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is that as computing capacity became cheaper, **processing time has become less important than coding-time**. Basically, the time you save by writing code in high-level yet slow to-run programming languages, compensates by their lack of performance at run time. And Python is exceptionally clean, intuitive, and easy to learn, compared to C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason, which is probably the major one, is **libraries**. Particularly libraries written in low-level high-performant languages. Turns out that Python extensibility allows programmers to write the \"engine\" for numerical computation in languages like C and Fortran, and then Python can invoke such \"engines\" in the background, meaning that although you write code in Python, it is executed in compiled C or Fortran code instead of Python itself. And that is how you obtain the best of both worlds: **the easy and fast developing time of Python, plus the runtime performance of C or Fortran**. True, there is some small overhead of going back and forth between languages, but its impact its minimal. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that nowadays, new programming languages has been created exactly with this two necessities (fast development + fast performance) in mind, like **[Julia](https://julialang.org/)**. In the spectral-norm test, Julia was benchmarked at ~2.79 seconds, almost as fast as C. Additionally, Julia is a dynamic language, easy to learn and write in like Python. Why not Julia then? Probably because of the relative immaturity of its packages ecosystem compared to Python. Julia first appeared in 2012, whereas Python was introduced in 1990. The availability of well-tested libraries for pretty much anything you can imagine in Python is unparalleled. A second reason is probably because Python does not cost you performance anyways (with its libraries), so Why not? "

    "If you are running this Notebook in `MyBinder` or locally after running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` file, you have `NumPy` installed already. Otherwise, you will need to install `NumPy` with one of this options:\n",

    "1. Scientific Python Distributions\n",
    "2. pip\n",
    "3. System-wide installation via package manager (apt, brew, etc.)\n",
    "4. From NumPy source code\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 4 is for developers who need to alter source code. Option 3 is not recommended as system-wide installation of packages may generate dependency conflicts. \n",

    "Option 1 is probably the simplest and it's widely used by practitioners. Within this category we have:\n",

    "- [Pyzo](https://pyzo.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "WinPython and Pyzo are less used and I do not have any experience with them. Feel free to experiment with them at your own risk. Anaconda and mini-conda are the most popular options. Anaconda basically is a large bundle of packages for Python and R, and a package manager. Mini-conda is a lightweight version of Anaconda.  Once you install Anaconda or mini-conda, `NumPy` will be available within the conda installation. \n",

I also see no reason to duplicate functionality which is already provided in the standard Python installation. It just occupies memory and you also need to learn how to use `conda`, which sometimes introduce hard to understand issues with multiple Python and packages installations. Yet, many people recommend and use this method. If you decide to use it, go to the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Mini-conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) site and follow the instructions for your system. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I highly recommend to create a virtual environment, activate the environment, and then install `NumPy` within that. It boils down to copy-pasting the following in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# create the virtual environment\n",
    "python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "\n",

    "pip3 install --upgrade pip\n",
    "\n",
    "#install numpy\n",
    "pip3 install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual environment will isolate your `NumPy` installation from your system-wide Python installation and other projects you may have in your computer. So, it's safer. This method will save you gigabytes of memory, time, confusion, and effort. But that's just me!"

    "Why on earth are there two methods to do exactly the same? The answer is that they are not doing the same: `ravel()` returns a '**view**' of the original array, whereas `flatte()` returns an independent '**copy**' of it. Views or images are just \"pointers\" to the original array in memory, whereas copies have their own space in memory. I'll cover this in depth later.\n",

    "\n",
    "Put simply, internally, `NumPy` arrays have two parts: the information itself and information about how to interpret/read the array. In the case of the shape information, this indicates how many \"indices\" are associated with an array. The `(1,6)` is saying that there **two indices** identifying the array: the number 1 for all the elements, and the numbers from 1 to 6 for each individual element. This makes sense if you think in array as matrices or excel sheets: the first element is in the firs row and first column (1,1), the second in the first row and the second column (1, 2), and son on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, If you think about it, you don't need two indices to identify the elements of a one-dimensional array. After all, when we count things we do not count \"1 and 1, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4...\" and so on. The `(6,)` is just saying that there is a **single index** identifying each of the 6 elements of the array, which makes perfect sense. The first element of the array is in position one (1,), the second in position two (2,), and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may be wondering. Why then to add a 1 as an index if it's unnecessary? Since `NumPy` supports multi-dimensional arrays, technically, the `(1,6)` is indicating the array has TWO dimensions or axes instead of one. \"BUT, the array has just one dimension, right?\" Yes and no. The thing is such array can be represented as either: as a collection of elements along one dimension or as collection of elements along two dimensions, with the caveat that the first dimension has all the data, and the other is basically \"empty\" or \"flat\", but assigned to it. Just like with the the first element is in the firs row and first column (1,1)\" idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with linear algebra or geometry, you should now that a square is an object with two dimensions, but that can 'live' in three, four, five, a million, or any number of dimensions. Essentially, higher-dimensional spaces can contain objects with less dimensions, but not the other way around. You can't fit an sphere in a plane. The misunderstanding, in my view, comes from the tendency to think in data as two-dimensional grid-like objects, when in practice does not need to be like that *necessarily*. People like to think in `NumPy` arrays as matrices, vectors, tensors, etc., but they aren't, they are arrays with one or more dimensions. Period. \n",
    "\n",
    "This whole discussion may sound like I am beating around the bushes, but I am not. Dimensionality mismatch is one of the most important sources of errors, misunderstandings, and frustrations when working with `NumPy` arrays. If you ever do anything related to linear algebra, like pretty much all of machine learning and statistics, you need to have a firm understanding of how dimensions work in `NumPy`. "
