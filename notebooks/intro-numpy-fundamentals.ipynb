    "Scientific and numerical computing often requires processing massive datasets with complex algorithms. If you are scientists or data professional, you want a programming language than can process data FAST. **The closer a programming language is to machine instructions (binary), the faster it runs**. That's why for decades, programs like C, C++, and Fortran, were the to-go option for data intensive applications in science and technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, writing code in compiled languages like C++ and Fortran can be slow and, frankly, terribly annoying (but that's just me!). Scientist are not coders (although many end up mutating into scientist-coder hybrids over time, but that's a whole other subject). From scientists perspective, **the easier and faster to write code, the better**. High-level programming languages, i.e., languages that are closer to human language rather than to machine language do meet such requirements. The likes of Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, fits the bill: **easy to write, easy to learn, easy to run**. But, instructions written in high-level programming languages are slow to run by computers, for complicated reasons I do not explore here. The fact is that they are slower to run than C++ or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists face a conundrum: they need an **easy to write** AND **fast to run** programming language. They need the best of both worlds. For a long time such language simply did not exist. Then Python came a long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh wait, Python it is, indeed, easy to learn and write, *but slow to run compared to compiled languages*. Like really, really slow. For instance, computing the [spectral-norm of a matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm), which is a common task in data applications, [has been benchmarked](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/performance/spectralnorm.html) at ~1.9 seconds in C, whereas python takes a whopping ~170.1 seconds, meaning that Python is ~90 times *slower*. Considering this, the fact Python became the dominant language in machine learning and data science is a bit of a puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two reasons for this why Python succeed anyways. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first is that as computing capacity became cheaper, **processing time has become less important than coding-time**. Basically, the time you save by writing code in high-level yet slow to-run programming languages, compensates by their lack of performance at run time. And Python is exceptionally clean, intuitive, and easy to learn, compared to C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason, which is probably the major one, is **libraries**. Particularly libraries written in low-level high-performant languages. Turns out that Python extensibility allows programmers to write the \"engine\" for numerical computation in languages like C and Fortran, and then Python can invoke such \"engines\" in the background, meaning that although you write code in Python, it is executed in compiled C or Fortran code instead of Python itself. And that is how you obtain the best of both worlds: **the easy and fast developing time of Python, plus the runtime performance of C or Fortran**. True, there is some small overhead of going back and forth between languages, but its impact its minimal. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that nowadays, new programming languages has been created exactly with this two necessities (fast development + fast performance) in mind, like **[Julia](https://julialang.org/)**. In the spectral-norm test, Julia was benchmarked at ~2.79 seconds, almost as fast as C. Additionally, Julia is a dynamic language, easy to learn and write in like Python. Why not Julia then? Probably because of the relative immaturity of its packages ecosystem compared to Python. Julia first appeared in 2012, whereas Python was introduced in 1990. The availability of well-tested libraries for pretty much anything you can imagine in Python is unparalleled. A second reason is probably because Python does not cost you performance anyways (with its libraries), so Why not? "

    "NumPy fundamental object is the **[ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html)**. Arrays are simply ordered collections of numbers, like singletons, [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html), [sets](https://realpython.com/python-sets/), [vectors](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra#vectors), [matrices](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra#matrices), or [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor). The \"n\" in \"ndarray\" makes references to the arbitrary number of dimensions it can take. An array with one element and one dimension, it's a \"singleton\" or just a number. An array with four elements and two dimensions, is a 2x2 matrix. Put simply, an array is like an Excel sheet with the caveat that instead of being restricted to two dimensions, it can be extended to 3, 4, or higher dimensions. \n",
